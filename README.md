# BirdUp Access

If the app doesn't find a match for bird, it's worth checking that the bird is in the list of birds associated with the current habitat. For example, say the current habitat is "UK Gardens and Parkland" and while the app's listening for birds, some honking canada geese fly overhead. Canada geese aren't in the list of birds for UK Gardens and Parkland and so the app will not say the birds were canada geese. Rather it might match the noise to some other bird in the list of birds for UK Gardens and Parkland, such as a jackdaw. If you would like the app to identify a canada goose, click on the "Change Habitat" button on the Birds page, and select "UK Rivers and Reedbeds". When you return to the Birds page, the canada goose will be included in the list of birds on the page. When you then go to the Listen page, it will say that the current habitat is UK Rivers and Reedbeds, and can identify canada geese. 

It's also worth checking if the bird that was not matched is appearing outside of its usual migration dates. For example, say a blackcap is appearing in March, which is before its more usual UK migration date of April. In that case, turn of the "Use migration dates" setting.

Note that the list of matched birds is sorted by confidence, so the highest confidence matches are at the top of the list. This means that if the full list of matches does not fit on the screen, the list might not appear to change when a new match is added to the list.
