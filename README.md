# BirdUp Access

If the app doesn't find a match for bird, it's worth checking that the bird is in the list of birds associated with the current habitat. For example, say the current habitat is "UK Gardens and Parkland" and while the app's listening for birds, some honking canada geese fly overhead. Canada geese aren't in the list of birds for UK Gardens and Parkland and so the app will not say the birds were canada geese. Rather it might match the noise to some other bird in the list of birds for UK Gardens and Parkland, such as a jackdaw. If you would like the app to identify a canada goose, click on the "Change Habitat" button on the Birds page, and select "UK Rivers and Reedbeds". When you return to the Birds page, the canada goose will be included in the list of birds on the page. When you then go to the Listen page, it will say that the current habitat is UK Rivers and Reedbeds, and can identify canada geese.
